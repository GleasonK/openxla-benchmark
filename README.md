# OpenXLA Benchmark Infrastructure

This is a home for the common benchmarking infrastructure described in the
[accompanying RFC](https://github.com/openxla/community/blob/main/rfcs/20230510-common-benchmark-suite.md).
It aims to be a common benchmark suite that is compiler-agnostic and can be used
in standalone comparative benchmark workflows and regression benchmarking
resident in each compiler project.
